# CherryBBCH81 Dataset

A dataset of cherry fruit images captured during the beginning of fruit coloration (BBCH stage 81) in the LatHort orchard in Dobele, Latvia.

## Dataset Description

The CherryBBCH81 dataset is designed for cherry fruit detection tasks. It contains high-resolution images of cherry trees captured at the beginning of fruit coloration, making it suitable for computer vision, object detection, and deep learning research in agricultural applications.

- **Number of images**: Original images (6016x4000) cropped into 640x640 images
- **Image format**: YOLO format
- **Overlap**: 30% between cropped images
- **BBCH stage**: 81 (beginning of ripening: berries begin to develop variety-specific colour)

## Dataset Structure

The dataset includes:
- Original high-resolution images (6016x4000)
- Cropped and annotated images (640x640)
- YOLO format annotations
- Two views per tree:
  - Perpendicular tree-facing view
  - Oblique view

## Data Collection

- **Location**: LatHort orchard in Dobele, Latvia
- **Timing**: At the beginning of fruit coloration (BBCH stage 81)
- **Annotation tool**: makesense.ai
- **Validation**: Manual validation of cropped images
